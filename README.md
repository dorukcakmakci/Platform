<h1>Game project for CS319 - Master</h1>

<p>Java implementation of a retro-style platformer game. </p>

IMPORTANT: The main source code for this project is contained in the "beta"
folder as other folders are either there for test or other side documents.

  Space Out is retro style sci-fi platformer game that anybody can use to "space out" from their 
boring life. It is implemented using Java. The game contains three distinct worlds each equipped with 
distinct features such as varying gravity, different block textures, enemies, surfaces etc. Each world 
has two levels in which the character progresses through. Even though the game is not completely 
story-driven, there is a sense of story provided with continuity throughout level and world endings. 
The goal of each level is to reach the finish by running through the platforms, destroy enemies and 
getting powerups as you do so and jumping over obstacles and traps. The character will be controlled 
by the arrow keys.
